% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations

\begin{abstract}
The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where
(almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere.
However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks
are complex and very hard to manage.  It is both difficult to
configure the network according to pre-defined policies, and to
reconfigure it to respond to faults, load and changes.  To make
matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically
integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together.
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that
promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical
integration, separating the network's control logic from the
underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of
network control, and introducing the ability to program the network.
The separation of concerns introduced between the definition of
network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the
forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking
the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier
to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying
network management and facilitating network evolution.

\coloredtext{In this paper we present a comprehensive survey on SDN.
We start by introducing the motivation for
SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional
networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm.}
Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN
infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach.  We provide an
in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and
northbound APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating
systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and
network applications.  We also look at cross-layer problems such as
debugging and troubleshooting.  In an effort to antecipate the future
evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research
efforts and challenges of SDN.  In particular, we address the design
of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as
resiliency, scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as
well as new opportunities for carrier transport
networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the
position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



%\section{Conclusion}
%The conclusion goes here.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
